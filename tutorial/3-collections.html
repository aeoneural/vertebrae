 * that makes them a breeze to use. I'll start you off both model and view: */

   * Make sure to do those first (!!!) and then check here for new patterns. */

 * - display every comment in it
 * - count the total number of votes, across all comments
 *
 * That means we need to write a new view: */

// That's it! Let's watch some stats:

/* Create a few new comment models using our Comment class: */
var commentList = [
  new Comment('Doug!'), // default to 0 votes
  new Comment('Doug?', 1),
  new Comment('Doug.', 2),

// Add all of these to a new collection:

// Associate a view to the collection:
var commentsView = new CommentsView({ collection: comments });

// Append it to the page (uncomment this when you are ready):
$('body').append(commentsView.render());
