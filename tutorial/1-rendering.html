// Now it is your turn.  

/* Here is what you start with:
 * You have a function. When you call it with a message argument,
 * it will 'render', or draw, that message onto the page using a template.
 *
 * The template part of the function is html that is the same for all messages.
 * Let's break this function down:
 */
var renderSomethingOnThePage = function(message) {
  /* We will use jQuery to append a message to the page,
   * but we dont want all of this HTML to be in the `el.append` function call.
   *
   * Instead, we break it out first into a variable called `$element`.
   * Now, we can call the `el.append` method with the `$element` variable.
   *
   * This also allows us to space out the html as we're used to,
   * with indents to make it easier to read.
   */

    '<div>',

   * How would you modify this template to add style to the look of the page?
   *
   * _Look below for one possible solution._
   */

  /* Here is the jQuery call to append this html string to the page's body.
   * Each time this function is called, the whole template defined above
   * is 'rendered', or drawn, with the message you pass to
   * the function argument.
   */
  $('body').append(html);

// Let's try it out:
renderSomethingOnThePage('This is an example of how to use our rendering method.');

/* Here are a few more examples. Every call to our rendering function (above)
 * will draw something to the page using the template defined in that function:
 */

// renderSomethingOnThePage('Each additional message you give this function...');
// renderSomethingOnThePage('...will draw a new message on the page!');

/* Let's revisit what we have learned from the last exercise.
 * We are working with a different application this time - we are going to be
 * working with messages received from some API
 * (like phone messages received from Twilio).
 *
 * Again, we extend a plain Backbone.Model to add extra stuff,
 * specific to our model.  The plain Backbone.Model comes with all the methods
 * that we will want to use later, so we just add the parts of the objects
 * that we will want to interact with.  This one is a little different than
 * the last time we extended the Backbone.Model: Last time, we didn't extend
 * the plain Backbone.Model at all - we left it blank.
 *
 * This time, we will see what you might want to extend the model with.
 *
 * _Confused about what `extend` means or does? This is all about the prototype
 * and inhertance. If you're stuck, halp yourself a teacher to explain._
 */
var Message = Backbone.Model.extend({  
  /* Our messages should have two methods that someone could call.
   * The first one, `initialize`, is specific to Backbone.
   *
   * When you were using ajax, if you defined a `success` function,
   * you could depend on that function being called once the data comes back
   * from the server. In Backbone, if you define a function and
   * call it `initialize`, Backbone will call that function
   * everytime you create a new model from the class that the
   * initialize function is defined on.
   *
   * In this case, anytime you use `new Message`, the object/model created
   * will have this `initialize` function run when the model is created.
   *
   * Before you continue, you should look up `initialize` in
   * [the documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-constructor).
   */
  initialize: function(){
    /* This code will be run when we instantiate a new message.
     *
     * Notice that we are calling `this.on()`.
     * This call is basically the same as the previous exercise.
     * Putting it into the initialize function let's us be sure that
     * all models that are created will have event listeners on them.
     */
    this.on('change', function(){ renderSomethingOnThePage(this.get('message')) });
    /* It is your turn to write the event handler.
     *
     * Make an event listener that will listen for a `change` in this model's
     * message attribute, then call the method we defined above
     * (`renderSomethingOnThePage`) and pass the message attribute
     * on the model as an argument.
     *
     * Try it yourself, then check out how the function was defined on the
     * previous exercise.
     */
  },

  /* This second method is specifically useful for this message.
   * In the future we will need to be able to alert the message on our model
   * and want to be able to call this function, so we define it on the model.
   */
  alertThisMessage: function() {
    /* Note: You will frequently be storing attributes on your models,
     * and the model needs to be aware of these changes,
     * hence the use of getters/setters.
     *
     * If you're curious about these functions, read up on them in
     * [the documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-get).
     */

/* How would you call the second method?
 *
 * Try it yourself, then check out the answer at the bottom of this script.

// Let's try it out: 'instantiate' an instance of the class defined above:
var myNewMessage = new Message();

// ...and then make a change on that model to see it render
myNewMessage.set({message: 'someMessage'});

var secondNew = new Message(); 
secondNew.set({ message: "Hello!"})
// myNewMessage.set({message: 'say something'})
myNewMessage.set({ message: "HELLO THERE"})

/* Once the model is rendering on the `change` event, move on to step 3!
 *
 * So far we have created models by extending Backbone.Model,
 * and we have gone over event listeners for models.
 *
 * We have also touched on some of the usefulness of understanding
 * what prototypes are, how they work, and their relation to `.extend`.
 *
 * Finally, we have touched on creating a template for a given model
 * (in this case a message).
 * However, doing it as a method can take a long time, and get a bit messy.
 *
 * In the next section, we will look into how Backbone
 * deals with these 'templates'.  The templating, as well as other
 * useful methods, are wrapped up into Backbone.View.
 */

/* - ANSWERS ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * To style your template, you could
 * - Add classes to the div, and a CSS (stylesheet) file
 *   - '<div class="message">'
 *   - this is the preferred method
 * - Add inline styles
 *   - Inline styles are generally not best practice - prefer stylesheets
 *
 *
 * To call `alertThisMessage` on the object: `myNewMessage.alertThisMessage();`
